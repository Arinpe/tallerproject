					<h1>Introduction to Web Development</h1>
					<p> 
						Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management
						Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).
					</p>
					<br>
					<p> 
						The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress and Adobe Experience Manager, among others.
					</p>

					<p>
						Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.
						Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career option. It is one of the easiest accessible high paid fields as you do not need a traditional university degree to become qualified.
						The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server side)
					</p>

					<h1>
						Difference between Front End Development and Back End Development
					</h1>

					<p>
						Front-end development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data. Front-end developers are concerned with what the user sees and interacts with directly.
					</p>

					<p>
						Back-end development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data. Front-end developers are concerned with what the user sees and interacts with directly.
					</p>

					<p>
						A front-end dev takes care of layout, design and interactivity using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They take an idea from the drawing board and turn it into reality.
						What you see and what you use, such as the visual aspect of the website, the drop down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series of programmes to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. These programmes are run through a browser.
						The backend developer engineers what is going on behind the scenes. This is where the data is stored, and without this data, there would be no frontend. The backend of the web consists of the server that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data.
						The backend dev uses computer programmes to ensure that the server, the application and the database run smoothly together. This type of dev need to analyse what a company’s needs are and provide efficient programming solutions. To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side languages, like PHP, Ruby, Python and Java.

						<h1>Introduction to Software Engineering</h1>
						<p>
							Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method. Software engineering is a computing discipline. The application of software engineering within the software development process is called software development. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to the development of software. Software engineering deals with the application of engineering principles to the development of software. It is a branch of computer science that focuses on the design, development, and maintenance of software. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to the development of software.

						<h2>Types Of Software</h2>
						<p>
							<h3>System software</h3> is used to provide core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management and other operational necessities.
						</p>
						<br>

						<p>
							<h3>Application software</h3> is used to perform specific tasks such as word processing, database management, spreadsheets, and other productivity tools.
						</p>
						<br>

						<p>
							<h3>
								Programming Software
							</h3>  is to give programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, 
							debuggers and other tools to create code.
						</p>
						<br>

						<p>
							<h3>programmers</h3> write source code to program computers for specific tasks like merging 
							databases, processing online orders, routing communications, conducting searches or displaying 
							text and graphics. Programmers typically interpret instructions from software developers and 
							engineers and use programming languages like C++ or Java to carry them out.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>Software Engineers</h3>  apply engineering principles to build software and systems to solve 
							problems. They use modeling language and other tools to devise solutions that can often be 
							applied to problems in a general way, as opposed to merely solving for a specific instance or 
							client. Software engineering solutions adhere to the scientific method and must work in the real 
							world, as with bridges or elevators. Their responsibility has grown as products have become 
							increasingly more intelligent with the addition of microprocessors, sensors and software. Not 
							only are more products relying on software for market differentiation, but their software 
							development must be coordinated with the product’s mechanical and electrical development 
							work.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>Software Developers</h3>  are responsible for the design, development, testing, and 
							maintenance of software. They are involved in the entire software development life cycle, 
							from the initial planning to the final testing and release. Software developers are also 
							responsible for the design of the software architecture, as well as the creation of the 
							software’s user interface. They are also responsible for the creation of the software’s 
							documentation, which includes the user manual and the technical manual. Software developers 
							are often required to work in teams, as they are often responsible for the development of 
							multiple software products.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>Software Architects</h3>  are responsible for the design of the software architecture. 
							Software architects are responsible for the design of the software architecture, as well as the 
							creation of the software’s user interface. They are also responsible for the creation of the 
							software’s documentation, which includes the user manual and the technical manual. Software 
							architects are often required to work in teams, as they are often responsible for the 
							development of multiple software products.
