            Software itself is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It is independent of hardware and makes computers programmable.
            Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software.
            Software development is the process programmers use to build computer programs. The process is also known as the Software Development Life Cycle, includes several phases that provide a method for building products that meet technical specifications and user requirements.
